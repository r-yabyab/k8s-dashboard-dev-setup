Comment

Fixes https://github.com/nephio-project/nephio/issues/355
Also added a check to see if the Yaml block is an object or not. The sample package 
from https://github.com/nephio-project/nephio-example-packages/blob/main/multus/multus-daemonset-thick.yml 
has an entire yaml block as comments with a ---, looking at the contents through webui triggers a runtime error.
