https://github.com/kptdev/kpt/blob/main/site/guides/porch-user-guide.md 
This is where I got the cmd to register my git repo with porchctl, the cmd use kpt alpha but we can just use porchctl, doesnâ€™t need webui
Remember that porchctl script to get it to run is done when porch isnt running, try installing porch then run it then stop then proceed with porchctl





- script for docker kind etc
- then newporch for cluster, kpt, porchctl, make
- webui sample packages
- porchctl external repo
    - public git repo with token (PAT)
    - need to run the startup commands or else it can't find main when pushing from nephio-webui
- run webui
    - takes like 1 hour for all of this, 30 minutes for porch and frontend, each



Fix:
- (for draft state) editing on webui then adding configmap then confirming sends watch to packagerevisionresource
  with new file count
- moving to next state always sends two events for both packagerevision and packagerevisionresources, maybe check if existing issue
