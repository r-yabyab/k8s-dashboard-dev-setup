For issue #643

run main script.sh to download docker, etc.
    - don't need to give perms to Ubuntu in the script because logged in as root
running backstage/script.sh to run web-ui
    - web-ui should not be picking anything up because 
then run porch local to see if I can use porchctl without kpt installed


for porch make all to run, got it to work when installed kpt
- at first it had this error when I didn't install kpt
    /usr/bin/ld: warning: x86_64.o: missing .note.GNU-stack section implies executable stack
    /usr/bin/ld: NOTE: This behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of the linker
