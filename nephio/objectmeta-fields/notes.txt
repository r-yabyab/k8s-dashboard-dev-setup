For issue #643

run main script.sh to download docker, etc.
    - don't need to give perms to Ubuntu in the script because logged in as root
running backstage/script.sh to run web-ui
    - web-ui should not be picking anything up because 
then run porch local to see if I can use porchctl without kpt installed
